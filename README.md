## üéØ Overview

YANETS focuses on the structural aspects of networking - helping you design and visualize how network devices connect and interact. Unlike full-stack network simulators that emulate actual traffic and protocols, YANETS specializes in topology design, validation, and documentation, making it lightweight, fast, and accessible.

- **üîß Multi-Vendor Support**: Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS, and extensible architecture for additional vendors
- **‚úÖ Stateful Device Simulation**: Maintains configuration, routing tables, interface states, and operational metrics
- **üì° Protocol Compliance**: SNMP v1/v2c with standard MIB-II support plus vendor-specific extensions
- **üñ•Ô∏è Web-Based Management**: RESTful API with Swagger documentation for topology and device management
- **üèóÔ∏è Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns across Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers
- **üíª Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS thanks to .NET's cross-platform capabilities
- **üîå Extensible**: Plugin architecture for adding new vendors, commands, and protocols
