## üéØ Overview

YANETS focuses on the structural aspects of networking - helping you design and visualize how network devices connect and interact. Unlike full-stack network simulators that emulate actual traffic and protocols, YANETS specializes in topology design, validation, and documentation, making it lightweight, fast, and accessible.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üåê Realistic Network Device Simulation**: Full CLI (Telnet/SSH) and SNMP emulation with authentic vendor behaviors
- **üîß Multi-Vendor Support**: Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS, and extensible architecture for additional vendors
- **‚úÖ Stateful Device Simulation**: Maintains configuration, routing tables, interface states, and operational metrics
- **üì° Protocol Compliance**: SNMP v1/v2c with standard MIB-II support plus vendor-specific extensions
- **üñ•Ô∏è Web-Based Management**: RESTful API with Swagger documentation for topology and device management
- **üèóÔ∏è Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns across Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers
- **üíª Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS thanks to .NET's cross-platform capabilities
- **üîå Extensible**: Plugin architecture for adding new vendors, commands, and protocols

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) or later
- Windows 10+, Linux, or macOS 10.15+

### Installation

#### Option 1: Download Release
Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/yanets/releases) page.

#### Option 2: Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yanets.git
cd yanets

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Start the Web API
cd 04_Presentation/WebUI
dotnet run
```

### Quick Start

1. **Start the Web API:**
   ```bash
   cd 04_Presentation/WebUI
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Access the API:**
   - API: `http://localhost:5000`
   - Swagger UI: `http://localhost:5000/swagger`
   - Health Check: `http://localhost:5000/health`

3. **Create a topology:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/topology \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Lab Network", "description": "Test laboratory network"}'
   ```

4. **Connect via Telnet:**
   ```bash
   telnet localhost 23001
   ```

5. **Query via SNMP:**
   ```bash
   snmpget -v 2c -c public localhost:16101 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

YANETS follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yanets.Core/              # Domain models and business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yanets.Application/       # Use cases and application services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yanets.Infrastructure/    # External services, file I/O, persistence
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yanets.UI/               # User interface (WPF/Avalonia/MAUI/Blazor)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Yanets.Plugins/          # Plugin system and extensibility
```

### Technology Stack

- **.NET 9**: Core framework with latest performance improvements
- **C# 13**: Programming language with modern features
- **[UI Framework]**: Cross-platform UI (Avalonia/MAUI/Blazor/WPF)
- **Graph Theory Libraries**: Topology analysis and path computation
- **JSON/YAML**: Topology file formats
- **xUnit**: Testing framework

## üéì Who is YANETS For?

- **Network Architects**: Design and validate network architectures before implementation
- **IT Students**: Learn network topology concepts and prepare for certifications (CCNA, CCNP, etc.)
- **System Administrators**: Document existing networks and plan infrastructure changes
- **Technical Leads**: Communicate network designs to stakeholders with clear visualizations
- **Consultants**: Rapidly prototype network solutions for client proposals
