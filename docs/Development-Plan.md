# YANETS Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the phased development approach for YANETS (Yet Another Network Equipment Test Simulator), a comprehensive network device simulation system. The project follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns across Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers.

## Architecture Summary

YANETS simulates network devices with realistic CLI (Telnet/SSH) and SNMP communication, supporting multiple vendor behaviors including Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS, and others. The system provides a visual topology management interface and supports complex network scenarios for testing and development purposes.
